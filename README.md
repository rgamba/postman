# Postman

Postman is a HTTP to AMQP reverse proxy that combines the ease of
implementing an HTTP API with the benefits of async inter-service communication.

Most of the HTTP services use a reverse proxy (nginx, Apache, etc) already, you can
think of **postman** as the async equivalent to those reverse proxies.

**Why async?**

REST over HTTP might not be the ideal protocol for internal microservice
communication, but it is certainly the easiest and fastest to implement.

AMQP or any other async protocol might be the best, but it is certainly
not as easy and straight forward to implement as regular HTTP. Plus, many
of our existing services use HTTP already.

Here is a simple diagram of how Postman works

**[TL;DR: Try out our demo](https://github.com/rgamba/postman-demo)**

**What are the benefits?**

- No load balancing needed.
- No service discovery needed.
- Forget about the complexities of implementing async calls.

**Here's how a typical `Service A -> Service B` request looks like using postman:**

```

    |               |             |             |             |

Service A        Service A     RabbitMQ      Service B     Service B
                 Postman                     Postman
```

In detail...

1. **Service A** sends a regular HTTP request to **Service B** via postman.
2. Postman on **Service A** gets the message and sends it over RabbitMQ.
3. RabbitMQ sends the message through to the next available **Service B** instance.
4. Postman on **Service B** gets the RabbitMQ message and creates a regular HTTP request to **Service B**
5. **Service B** processes the request and send a response back.
6. Postman on **Service B** sends the response through RabbitMQ.
7. Postman on **Service A** gets the response.
8. Postman on **Service A** send the response back to **Service A** as a regular HTTP response.

These may look like a lot of steps, the good thing is that from the perspective of **Service A** 
(who made the request on the first place), it all looks like a very simple HTTP request to **Service B**.

# Installation

To install, just download the appropriate binary from the releases, extract and execute
directly or, preferrably, copy to one dir inside your `PATH`. No other dependencies required.

## Getting started

```bash
postman -config /path/to/config.toml
```

# Compile from source

```bash
go get github.com/rgamba/postman
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/rgamba/postman
make
make install
```

# API

## Send an HTTP request

To send an HTTP request to any service, the only thing you need to know is
the server name identifier. This is a unique name. That's it. No IPs or hostnames needed
to remember. You need to send all requests to the local **postman** which will typically
be running in the instance's `http://localhost:8130/<servicename>/`

Suppose there is a service called **user-data** that exposes a POST endpoint `/:user_id/update`
and accepts the following JSON body:

```
{
    "name": "new name",
    "last_name": "new last name"
}
```

To reach this endpoint on **user-data** from any other service on the network, we just need to:
(User id: 123)

```bash
curl -X POST -d '{"name": "new name", "last_name": "new last name"}' http://localhost:8130/user-data/123/update
```

That's it!

## Discarding a response

Sometimes we need to send a request that will take a long time to complete, therefore it is not practical
to wait for the response right away. On those cases we just need to discard the response by sending the
following HTTP header on the request:

```
Discard-Response: Yes
```

The response will always be an immediate HTTP response with `201` status code and no body.

# Dashboard

Each postgres instance comes with a built-in dashboard service which by default you can access on `http://localhost:18130`

# Stats API

## Get Request metrics

```bash
curl http://localhost:18130/stats/requests
```

Response

```javascript
{
    "incoming": {
        "last_minute": {
            "<service-name>": 1
        }
    }, 
    "outgoing": {
        "last_minute": {
            "<service-name>": 1
        }
    }
}
```
